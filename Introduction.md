## Introduction

**Reality, conditionally, cannot be fully understood.**  
From this perspective, every act of observation and experimentation may be inherently flawed.  
What then, can an individual do — without access to institutional tools or external validation — to explore the structure of the world in a meaningful way?

This essay begins a personal and public journey. It is a subjective exploration framed by epistemological caution, yet driven by the human need to grasp meaning.

## On Personal Experimentation

As an ordinary citizen, I can conduct experiments, but they will always carry the question:  
**How valid is an experiment of one?**  
This problem intensifies in cases where perception itself is impaired or in flux.

I seek to investigate this by examining three sensory channels — the portals through which I interface with the world:

1. **Hearing**  
2. **Vision**  
3. **Touch**

These will serve as the basis of my inquiry.

## Methodology and Intent

I will incorporate:
- **Quantitative methods** where possible (e.g., sensory thresholds, decibel sensitivity)
- **Qualitative narrative accounts** of perception and distortion
- **Mixed methods** to bridge inner and outer measurements

**Bias** will be addressed by:
- Engaging peer reviewers and readers
- Maintaining transparency in my assumptions
- Collecting multiple feedback layers

## Toward a Publicly-Reflective Inquiry

This document is a seed for wider conversation. I will seek feedback from others in similar situations — individuals living with altered perception — to **assemble a multi-perspective framework** of what it means to “perceive the real.”

If perception is a filter, and filters differ, what can we say about **reality as a shared space**?

Let this not be a solitary search, but a **collective reflection**.
