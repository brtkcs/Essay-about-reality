# Hello World.

This repo is the home of my public essay.

My plan is to make it a public document that anyone can contribute to. 
I encourage you to do so, which you can do through [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) at the following link:

I find it extremely important that there is a universal concept of reality perception.
Although I am not a scientist or researcher myself, I believe that there is an increasing need for something like this.

That's all I can say about myself in this essay, I am currently a non-practicing artist who is trying to learn about existence.
While I was searching, this question arose in me.

Feel free to join me, comment, I am of course happy to accept criticism.
