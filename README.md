Welcome.

## What is this project about?

This is not a finished academic paper.  
It is an open-ended inquiry â€” both personal and public â€” into how we come to understand reality, especially when perception is altered or unstable.

The project blends:

- subjectivity and methodological caution,  
- philosophical reflection and creative process,  
- slow thinking and embodied knowledge.

You are welcome to contribute with:

- comments and suggestions on HackMD,  
- critical questions, personal reflections, or shared experiences.
